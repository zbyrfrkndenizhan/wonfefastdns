Wonfe DNS is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black hole," thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public Wonfe DNS servers -- both share a lot of common code.
How does Wonfe DNS compare to traditional ad blockers
It depends.

"DNS sinkholing" is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks flexibility and power of traditional ad blockers. You can get a good impression about the difference between these methods by reading this article. It compares Wonfe DNS for Android (a traditional ad blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based blockers in their capabilities).

However, this level of protection is enough for some users. Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can't install tradtional ad blockers).

Known limitations

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

YouTube, Twitch ads
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts
Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future? DNS will never be enough to do this. Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the standalone Wonfe DNS applications. We're going to bring this feature support to Wonfe DNS in the future. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still will be cases when this won't be enough or would require quite complicated configuration.

This project is due to being supported by other open source projects.

İMPORTANT!
It runs stably on CentOS 7.
Wonfe DNS is not responsible for any possible problem!
